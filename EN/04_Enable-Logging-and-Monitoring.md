# Enable Logging and Monitoring
([Return](/README.md) | [Français](/FR/04_Activer-la-journalisation-et-la-surveillance.md))

## Objective

Continuously monitor system events and performance and include a security audit log function in all information systems to enable the detection of incidents. It is essential that an adequate level of logging and reporting is in place, including a security audit log function in all information systems hosted in the cloud environment and for cloud-based workloads.

## Key Considerations

### Logging

* [ ] Ensure that only administrators have access to the [security investigation tool](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7575955).
* [ ] Leverage the Admin audit log to review a history of every task performed in the Google Admin console: which admin performed the task, the date, and the IP address from which the admin signed in.
* [ ] Ensure you [create and manage activity rules](https://support.google.com/a/answer/9275024?hl=en) to help prevent, detect, and remediate security issues more quickly and efficiently.
* [ ] Ensure you [create and manage reporting rules](https://support.google.com/a/answer/9908423?hl=en) to set up alerts based on log event data.
* [ ] Identify the events within the solution that must be audited in accordance with [GC Event Logging](https://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/gcwiki/images/e/e3/GC_Event_Logging_Strategy.pdf)

### Monitoring

The security center provides advanced security information and analytics, and added visibility and control into security issues affecting your domain. 

* [ ] Regularly visit the [Security Center](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7492003?hl=en) to review your security posture, investigate incidents, and take action based on that information.
* [ ] Continuously monitor system events and performance. Ensure reports are reviewed at least weekly including:
  * [User reports: Accounts](https://support.google.com/a/answer/4580176?hl=en&ref_topic=9026833#zippy=%2Cgeneral)
  * [User reports: App usage](https://support.google.com/a/answer/4579578?hl=en&ref_topic=9026833)
  * [User reports: Security](https://support.google.com/a/answer/6000269?hl=en&ref_topic=9026833)
  * [DLP incidents report](https://support.google.com/a/answer/9304818?hl=en&ref_topic=7492004)
* [ ] Leverage the [Security Dashboard](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7492534?hl=en&ref_topic=7492004) to see an overview of data from several security center reports. 
* [ ] Leverage the [Security Investigation](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7575955?hl=en#) tool to identify, triage, and take action on security and privacy issues in your domain. For example, you can use the investigation tool to:
  * Access data about devices.
  * Access device log data to get a clear view of the devices and applications being used to access your data.
  * Access data about Gmail messages, including email content. 
  * Access Gmail log data to find and erase malicious emails, mark emails as spam or phishing, or send emails to users’ inboxes.
  * View search results that list suspended users.
  * Access Drive log data to investigate file sharing in your organization, investigate the creation and deletion of documents, investigate who accessed documents, and more.
* [ ] Leverage the [Security Health page](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7492705#data-leaks) to gain better visibility into your Admin console and better understand and manage security risks.
* [ ] Configure alerts and notifications to be sent to the appropriate contact/team in the organization.
* [ ] Configure or use an authoritative time source for the time-stamp of the audit records generated by your solution components.
* [ ] Develop a plan to respond to and understand the impact of security incidents, in accordance with the [GC Cyber Security Event Management Plan](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/access-information-privacy/security-identity-management/government-canada-cyber-security-event-management-plan.html)
* [ ] Establish an MOU for defensive services and threat monitoring protection services with CCCS.

## Additional Considerations

* [ ] Consider the use of a central logging solution whenever and wherever possible. Capabilities that automate event and behaviour analysis, and offer real-time alerting can help to identify possible security threats and incidents.
* [ ] Consider the [export of Google Workspace logs](https://support.google.com/a/answer/9320190) and usage reports to Google Cloud Platform services.
* [ ] Perform Admin auditing for the security center.
      Many security center tasks are recorded through the Admin log event data source in the security investigation tool. This log data enables you to track the history of tasks performed in your Google Admin console, including which administrator performed the tasks. 

## Validation

* [ ] Validate that policy for event logging is implemented.
* [ ] Validate that event logs are being generated.
* [ ] Validate that security contact information has been configured to receive alerts and notifications.
* [ ] Validate that there is a plan in place to respond to incidents.
