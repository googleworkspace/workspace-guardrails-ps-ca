## Objective

Use built-in tools to validate the security configuration and recommendations for Google Workspace and apply recommendations as appropriate to improve security posture. Ensure that there is a consistent level of protection across GC data, identities, and devices.

## Key Considerations

* [ ] Validate that the recommendations described in the [Security checklist](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7587183#) have been considered or implemented.
* [ ] Use the [security center](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7492003?hl=en#), [security dashboard and security health tools](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7486127?hl=en&ref_topic=7486732) to monitor the activity and security of your Google Workspace environment.
* [ ] Compare current state posture with benchmarks and establish key performance indicators (KPIs)

## Validation

* [ ] TBD
